	font-weight: normal;font-size: 30px;">The 2nd Joint Workshop on <br /> CPS & IoT Security and Privacy</p>



<h4 style="margin-top: 0;"> <strong> In conjunction with the <br />  
<a href="https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2021/" target="_blank"> <strong> ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security 2021 </strong> </a> </strong> </h4>

## Background

The Joint Workshop on CPS&IoT Security and Privacy (CPSIoTSec) is the result of the merger of the Workshop on Cyber-Physical Systems Security and Privacy (CPS-SPC) and Workshop on the Internet of Things Security and Privacy (IoTS&P) previously organized annually in conjunction with ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security.


<span style="color:red">**<u>NEW</u>**</span> **DEADLINE EXTENDED FOR 2 WEEKS (FIRM DEADLINE: JULY 13th, 2021)** 

<!-- ## Program -->





## Scope
The 2nd Workshop on CPS&IoT Security and Privacy (CPSIoTSec 2021) invites academia, industry,
and governmental entities to submit:

* Original research papers on the security and privacy of CPS&IoT
* Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers on the security and privacy of CPS&IoT
* Demos (hands-on or videos) of testbeds/experiences of CPS&IoT security and privacy research

We seek submissions from multiple interdisciplinary backgrounds tackling security and privacy issues in CPS&IoT, including but not limited to:
* Mathematical foundations for secure CPS/IoT
* Control-theoretic approaches
* High assurance security architectures
* Security and resilience metrics
* Metrics and risk assessment approaches
* Identity and access management
* Privacy and trust
* Network security
* Game theory applied to CPS/IoT security
* Human factors, humans in the loop, and usable security
* Understanding dependencies among security, reliability and safety in CPS/IoT
* Economics of security and privacy
* Intrusion and anomaly detection
* Model-based security systems engineering
* Sensor and actuator attacks
* CPS/IoT malware analysis
* CPS/IoT firmware analysis
* Hardware-assisted CPS/IoT security


Also of interest will be papers that can point the research community to new research directions,
and those that can set research agendas and priorities in CPS/IoT security and privacy.
**There will be a best paper award.**





## Submission Guidelines


Submissions include ***long papers (12 pages)***, ***short papers (6 pages)***, or ***1-page abstracts***:
* Long papers include a) Original research on a CPS/IoT security and privacy topic, b) Systematization
of Knowledge of CPS/IoT security and privacy;
* Short papers include original work-in-progress research on a CPS/IoT security and privacy
topic;
* 1-page abstracts include demos/interesting findings/insights on CPS/IoT security and privacy,
which will be accompanied by a hands-on demo during the workshop.

Submitted papers can be **up to 12 or 6 pages** including appendices and references (except
for SoK papers where references are excluded). Submissions must use the ACM SIG Proceedings
Templates (see <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template" target="_blank">https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template</a>, with a simpler version here:
<a href="https://github.com/acmccs/format" target="_blank">https://github.com/acmccs/format</a>.
Only PDF files will be accepted.

Accepted papers will be published by the ACM Press and/or the ACM Digital Library. Submissions must not
substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted
to a journal or a conference with proceedings. Each accepted paper must be presented by a registered
author. Submissions not meeting these guidelines risk immediate rejection. For questions
about these policies, please contact the chairs.

**<u>NEW FOR 2021:</u>** *The workshop will feature a second paper submission deadline for papers that have been submitted but not accepted to the main conference. The deadline will be 10 days after the paper notification is out.
Authors are not required to upload CCS reviews; verification of CCS submission status will be done by informing the program chairs of the paper ID of the CCS submission.*
