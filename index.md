	font-weight: normal;font-size: 30px;">The Joint Workshop on <br /> CPS & IoT Security and Privacy</p>



<h4 style="margin-top: 0;"> <strong> In conjunction with the <br />  
<a href="https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2020/" target="_blank"> <strong> ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security 2020 </strong> </a> </strong> </h4>

## Background

The Joint Workshop on CPS&IoT Security and Privacy (CPSIoTSec) is the result of the merger of the Workshop on Cyber-Physical Systems Security and Privacy (CPS-SPC) and Workshop on the Internet of Things Security and Privacy (IoTS&P) previously organized annually in conjunction with ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security.


## Scope
The Joint Workshop on CPS&IoT Security and Privacy invites academia, industry, and governmental entities to submit:
*	Original research papers on the security and privacy of CPS and IoT
*	Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers on the security and privacy of CPS and IoT
*	Demos (hands-on or videos) of testbeds/experiences of CPS and IoT security and privacy research


We seek submissions from multiple interdisciplinary backgrounds tackling security and privacy issues in CPS and IoT, including but not limited to:
*	Mathematical foundations for secure CPS/IoT
*	Control-theoretic approaches
*	High assurance security architectures
*	Security and resilience metrics
*	Metrics and risk assessment approaches
*	Identity and access management
*	Privacy and trust
*	Network security
*	Game theory applied to CPS/IoT security
*	Human factors, humans in the loop, and usable security
*	Understanding dependencies among security, reliability and safety in CPS/IoT
*	Economics of security and privacy
*	Intrusion and anomaly detection
*	Model-based security systems engineering
*	Sensor and actuator attacks
*	CPS/IoT malware analysis
*	CPS/IoT firmware analysis
*	Hardware-assisted CPS/IoT security

Also, of interest will be papers that can point the research community to new research directions, and those that can set research agendas and priorities in CPS/IoT security and privacy.
**There will be a best paper award.**

## Submission Guidelines
Submissions include ***long papers (12 pages)*** and ***short papers (6 pages)***.

#### Long papers include:
1. Original research on a CPS/IoT security and privacy topic
2. Systematization of Knowledge of CPS/IoT security and privacy

#### Short papers include:
1. Original preliminary research on a CPS/IoT security and privacy topic
2. Demos/interesting findings/insights on CPS/IoT security and privacy

Submitted papers can be up to 12 or 6 pages including appendices and references (except for SoK papers where references are excluded). Submissions must use the format defined by CCS [(https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2020/call-for-papers.html)](https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2020/call-for-papers.html). Only PDF files will be accepted. Accepted papers will be published by the ACM Press and/or the ACM Digital Library. Submissions must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with proceedings. Each accepted paper must be presented by a registered author. Submissions not meeting these guidelines risk immediate rejection. For questions about these policies, please contact the chairs.
